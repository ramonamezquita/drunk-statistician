Say you are a student sitted in the front line in a lecture on random variables.

Right after the lecturer enters the classroom a slight sense of alcohol, which
you decide to ignore, starts settling across room. 

Suddenly, as if looking for some kind of confrontation, a loud affirmation from the lecturer:
*"Random variables are neither random or variable, they simply are real-valued 
functions."*

That's odd, you think. Where does the name come from, then?

The lecturer turns to the board and slowly starts writing todays topic:
*"Transformation of random variables"*. 

When the professor turns back again you notice some signs of decadency, the
untucked shirt, missing buttons, messy hair, dirty shoes and you think to 
yourself: what a guy! He probably spend the night working on his research.

With some stumbling the lecturer proceeds on the board:

Let $Y = g(X)$ where $X$ is any random variable and 
$g: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$. Then,

<Latex/>
$$
\mathbf{E}\left[Y\right] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)p_{X}(x) dx
$$

How can the expected value of $Y$ does not depend on its actual distribution?
Where is $p_{Y}(y)$?
Does anybody actually believe this result? 
Or is he just joking around?
Juding from this statement, the lecturer must definetly be on *something*!


A thing about drunk people however is that more often than not, they are telling
the truth.


## The law of the drunk statistician
Also known as The Law Of The Unconsious Statistician (LOTUS) or simply, the
expected value rule, states that



## Proof

```python

def foo(x) -> int:
    return x
